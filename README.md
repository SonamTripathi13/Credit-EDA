### Problem Statement:
The company faces challenges in lending to customers due to insufficient or non-existent credit history, which can lead to defaults. The primary risks involved are:
1. **Business loss**: Rejecting applicants who can repay their loans results in lost opportunities.
2. **Financial loss**: Approving loans to applicants who are likely to default leads to financial loss for the company.

The goal is to identify patterns in loan applications that can help determine whether a customer is likely to default on a loan. The company must make informed decisions about loan approval to minimize risk, ensuring that only suitable applicants receive loans while protecting the business from defaults.

### Business Objectives:
The objective is to apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in consumer and loan data that predict whether a client will have difficulty repaying their installments. This information will be used to:
- Deny loans to risky applicants.
- Offer reduced loan amounts to high-risk applicants.
- Charge higher interest rates to applicants who are likely to default.
- Ensure that customers who are capable of repaying loans are not rejected.

By identifying the variables that influence loan default, the company can improve its portfolio and risk assessment strategies, thus ensuring better financial decision-making.
